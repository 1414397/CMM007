<p>Cheese is a dairy product made from cream, curdled or skimmed milk, or a mixture of these. It can range from mild,
    fresh soft cheeses such as cream cheese, to pungently flavoured, mature blue cheeses such as Stilton, or aged hard
    cheeses such as Parmesan, which are very dry in texture.Made around the world from cow, sheep, water buffalo,
    goat and even reindeer milk, cheese is sold pasteurised or raw, plain or flavoured, pickled, processed or even,
    occasionally, sweet.
