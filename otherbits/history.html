        No one really knows who made the first cheese. According to an ancient legend,
        it was made accidentally by an Arabian merchant who put his supply of milk into
        a pouch made from a sheep's stomach, as he set out on a day's journey across the
        desert. The rennet in the lining of the pouch, combined with the heat of the sun,
        caused the milk to separate into curd and whey. That night he found that the whey
        satisfied his thirst,and the cheese (curd) had a delightful flavor which satisfied
        his hunger
